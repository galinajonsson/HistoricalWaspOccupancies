# Historical Wasp Occupancies

Author(s): [Galina M. Jönsson](https://github.com/galinajonsson)

This repository contains all the code and some data for:

>Jönsson, G. M., Broad, G. R., Sumner, S. and Isaac, N. J. B. (2020). A century of social wasp occupancy trends from natural history collections: spatiotemporal resolutions have little effect on model performance.  Unpublished manucript. 


## Data
We used two sources of data: specimen records from the Natural History Museum, London (NHM), and observational records from the Bees, Ants and Wasps Recording Society (BWARS). The BWARS data is available upon request from:
>The National Biodiversity Network
Unit F, 14-18 St. Mary’s Gate
Lace Market
Nottingham, UK
Telephone: +44 (0)115 850 0177
Email: support@nbn.org.uk

For reproducibility purposes download this and place it into a `rawdata/` or `data/` folder as appropriate to rerun our analyses. 

The full NHM dataset is available via the [NHM data portal](https://data.nhm.ac.uk/doi/10.5519/qd.tdi9zagc). If you use it, please cite as folows:

In this repository, we have uploaded the raw NHM data for all Vespula vulgaris, Vespula germanica and Vespa crabro specimens in folder `data/rawData`, as well as the cleaned NHM data in the folder `data/cleanData` and auxiliary data in `data/auxiliaryData`.

We were unable to upload the formatted date files and the model output files to GitHub because the files are too large. These files will be made available on Dryad after the manuscript has been accepted for publication. 

## Data wrangling


## Analyses

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

## Other folders

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
